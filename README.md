# Galaxy Shooter!

Galaxy Shooter is a dynamic space shooter in which players are tasked with defeating hostile hordes of alien beings. During the gameplay, players encounter various bonuses that affect their combat abilities.

<p>The first of the bonuses is a heart, which increases the player's number of lives by 1. This gives the ability to survive in difficult situations.</p><img align="middle" alt="Coding" width="40" src="https://github.com/dbarans/Galaxy-Shooter/blob/master/Assets/Sprites/heart.png">

The second type of bonus is ammunition, which increases the number of turrets firing from the player's ship. Instead of the standard one turret, the player can now use up to three, which increases firepower and combat effectiveness.

The third bonus is the lightning bolt, which increases the player's speed. This allows the player to move faster, dodge enemy attacks and gain a tactical advantage.

There are three types of enemies in the game. The first type is green enemies, which are very fast, but do not shoot. The second type is red enemies that move forward and shoot at the same time. The third type is blue enemies that move sideways, have 2 life points and also shoot.

The game rewards the player for defeating enemies by awarding points. The player gets extra points when he collects a bonus and he already has the maximum number of hearts, shooting turrets or maximum speed.
